# CollatzConjecture

This is an expirement with the collatz conjecture problem. 
We have a number: n and two cases 
If n is odd, then we are going to multiply it with 3 and add a 
If n is even, then we are dividing it with 2 
This procedure is repeated until b is reached.
Usage: 
Per default is n 28, a 1 and b 1 
You can change that by adding ?n=23 etc to the url 
Examples:
?n=12
?n=51&b=4
?b=2
